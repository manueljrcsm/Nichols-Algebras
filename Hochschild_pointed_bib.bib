  title       = {Cohomology rings of finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras over abelian groups, I \& II},
  abstract    = {We show that the cohomology ring of a finite-dimensional complex pointed Hopf algebra with an abelian group of group-like elements is finitely generated. The proof has three parts. Part I itself splits further into two steps. First, we reduce the problem to finite generation of cohomology for finite dimensional Nichols algebras of diagonal type. Second, using spectral sequence arguments and detailed analysis of cohomology via the Anick resolution we reduce the problem further to specific combinatorial properties of Nichols algebras. Parts II and III of the proof carry out verifications of these combinatorial properties using case-by-case calculations through the classification of Heckenberger. Part II, the computational heart of the present paper, deals with the major parametric families, including Nichols algebras of Cartan and super types. It also develops all the theoretical foundations and provides detailed proofs necessary for the case-by-case analysis. Part III, which will appear as a separate publication, addresses the remaining Nichols algebras which fall into smaller discrete families and require computer calculations as the number of different possibilities to verify is considerable. As an application of the main theorem we deduce finite generation of cohomology for other classes of finite-dimensional Hopf algebras, including basic Hopf algebras with abelian groups of characters and finite quotients of quantum groups at roots of one.},
